This is code to get you started.
You need to write code for 3 functions:

    def getAction(state):
        given the current state, return either:
          'SUCK', 'MOVELEFT' or 'MOVERIGHT'
     - in R with dirt -> SUCK
     - in L with dirt -> SUCK
     - in R no dirt   -> MOVELEFT
     - in L no dirt   -> MOVERIGHT

    def updateState(state, action)
        return the next state given current state and action
            action:SUCK vacRoom:R -> ['R', [.., 0]]
            action:SUCK vacRoom:L -> ['L', [0, ..]]
            action:MOVELEFT  vacRoom:R -> ['L', .. ]
            action:MOVERIGHT vacRoom:L -> ['R', .. ]
            other state action pairs: -> no change to state
            note: in above, ... means no change

    def bool_all_rooms_clean(state):
        #returns True or False  if all room are clean or not

def getAction(state):
    '''state: current state
       return  the action based on state
    '''
    # add code so that the appropriate choice is returned

    return None  # replace

    # if

            print(
                "Uh oh ! Code stuck in a state ... program terminated")
            return

    print("All rooms clean!")
    return


def main():
    # when you run this code without implementing above functions
    # the program will stop after 20 cycles
    # Part 1: Start in room R
    start_state = ['R', [1, 1]]
